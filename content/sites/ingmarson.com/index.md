A fast Gatsby progressive web app (PWA) built by Tim Walpole for INGMARSON using Snipcart, Forestry.io and other JAMstack tech.

> "As a small (growing) company owner, Robert wants to be able to concentrate on what is important—delivering high quality, ethically sourced clothing designs. We don’t want to have to worry about maintaining a high-cost website, ensuring security, staying up-to-date, or meeting GDPR regulations for data storage."

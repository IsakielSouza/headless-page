A Front-Commerce project using a headless Magento2 store, to sell giftcards and giftboxes for “Chaîne Thermale du Soleil” and “Compagnie des Spas”‘s trips.

<br/>

> "It’s a migration from a Magento1 CE.
>
> Our client liked the ability to adapt the funnel whether there is a shipping to handle or not, the built-in labels on products (instead of using an extension for that) and the easiness to put some specific custom behavior."

Here is a non-exhaustive list of specific project developments:

- Built-in specific product’s labels on certain conditions (free delivery, X% discount)
- AMASTY’s Gift Card extension support
- A product can be virtual or physical after customer’s choice, impacting the need of shipping step
- No shipping step in the funnel if only virtual products are ordered
- PDF custom generation (for gift certificates) with client’s business logic for numbering
- Google Maps on product page as an attribute
- Inserting a custom page as a product in a category listing

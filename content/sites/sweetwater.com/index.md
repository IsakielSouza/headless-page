Sweetwater has very deep site, filled with asset-rich content. And with those parameters, they were able to leverage PWA service workers to make a huge improvement in load time and performance, particularly on low-bandwidth mobile connections. Sweetwater was also able to create a limited offline mode with phone ordering and customer service information. That is a huge step forward vs. leaving their offline customers stuck with a never-ending page loading animation.
